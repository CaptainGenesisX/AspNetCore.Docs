# What's new in ASP.NET Core 7.0 preview

This article highlights the most significant changes in ASP.NET Core 7.0 with links to relevant documentation.

## API controllers

Parameter binding for API controller actions binds parameters through [dependency injection](xref:fundamentals/dependency-injection) when the type is configured as a service. This means it’s no longer required to explicitly apply the [`[FromServices]`](xref:Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.FromServicesAttribute) attribute to a parameter. In the following code, both action return the time:

[!code-csharp[](~/release-notes/aspnetcore-7/samples/ApiController/Controllers/MyController.cs?name=snippet)]

In rare cases, automatic DI can break apps that have a type in DI that is also accepted in an API controllers action methods. It's not common to have a type in DI and as an argument in an API controller action. To disable automatic binding of parameters, set `DisableImplicitFromServicesParameters = true`:

### Shadow copying in IIS

An experimental feature has been added to the <xref:host-and-deploy/aspnet-core-module> to add support for [shadow copying application assemblies](/dotnet/framework/app-domains/shadow-copy-assemblies). Currently .NET locks application binaries when running on Windows making it impossible to replace binaries when the app is running. While our recommendation remains to use an [app offline file](xref:host-and-deploy/iis/app-offline), we recognize there are certain scenarios (for example FTP deployments) where it isn’t possible to do so.

In such scenarios, enable shadow copying by customizing the ASP.NET Core module handler settings. In most cases, ASP.NET Core apps do not have a `web.config` checked into source control that you can modify. In ASP.NET Core, `web.config` is ordinarily generated by the SDK. The following sample `web.config` can be used to get started:
